#StoryViz

> StoryViz aims to give fans a new understanding of their favorite books by enabling interactive exploration of character networks. Users can flip through story views that show how characters relate to each other over time. Imagine seeing when characters murder each other in Game of Thrones or when they are traveling together in Lord of the Rings. Fans can also contribute to a story view by building relationships between characters.
