#StoryViz visualizes the social networks in your favorite stories

StoryViz aims to give fans a new understanding of their favorite books by enabling interactive exploration of character networks. Users can flip through story views that show how characters relate to each other over time.
Imagine seeing when characters murder each other in Game of Thrones or when they are traveling together in Lord of the Rings. Fans can also contribute to a story view by building relationships between characters. 

Reading or watching a story can paint a confusing picture of how characters relate to each other and how their relationships evolve over time. This is especially salient for stories with numerous characters or complicated social networks, which is becoming increasingly prevalent in today’s media rich environment. Additionally, experts in a fandom find it difficult to share their knowledge without visual aids.

StoryViz offers users the ability to gain unique perspectives and insights into their favorite stories. Whether it’s exploring the network of murder and revenge in Game of Thrones, visualizing the friendships formed over the course of seven years at Hogwarts in Harry Potter, or keeping tabs on who’s travelling with who at a certain point in Lord of the Rings, StoryViz unveils your inner geek in ways you never thought possible. Users can contribute to a story network by adding characters and relationships, enabling the creation of large, complex networks.
